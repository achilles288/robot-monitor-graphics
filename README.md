![RMG Robot Logo](./docs/images/logo_home.png)

Simple and quick 2D/3D graphics rendering engine with the aim for making robotic simulations. Loads 2D/3D model files and texture files and easily control the pose and appearance of those 2D/3D objects. Lighting and shadow mapping are done in back-end processes. Performance is smooth since rendering engine uses shader programs and GPU power. The project uses **OpenGL** API and other external open source packages like **GLFW** and **wxWidgets** and is made a cross-platform API.
